            <h2>Introduction to Logistic Regression</h2>
            <p>Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. Unlike linear regression, it predicts the probability of an event occurring by fitting data to a logistic function.</p>

            <h2>Types of Logistic Regression</h2>
            <h3>1. Binary Logistic Regression</h3>
            <p>In binary logistic regression, the output variable (target) has two possible outcomes (0 or 1).</p>

            <h3>2. Multinomial Logistic Regression</h3>
            <p>Multinomial logistic regression is used when the output variable has more than two categories, predicting the probability of each category.</p>

            <h2>Applications of Logistic Regression</h2>
            <p>Logistic regression is applied in various domains, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Healthcare for disease diagnosis and patient outcome prediction</li>
                <li>Finance for credit scoring and fraud detection</li>
                <li>Marketing for customer churn prediction and segmentation</li>
                <li>Social sciences for predicting voting outcomes and survey analysis</li>
                <li>Image and speech recognition systems for pattern classification</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Challenges and Considerations</h2>
            <p>Challenges in logistic regression include the assumption of linear relationship between variables, overfitting, and handling imbalanced datasets. Techniques like regularization and feature selection are used to enhance model performance.</p>
