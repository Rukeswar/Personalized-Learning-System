            <h2>Introduction to Linear Regression</h2>
            <p>Linear regression is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values based on input data. It assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (features) and the output variable (target).</p>

            <h2>Types of Linear Regression</h2>
            <h3>1. Simple Linear Regression</h3>
            <p>In simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable (feature) used to predict the dependent variable (target). The relationship is represented by a straight line.</p>

            <h3>2. Multiple Linear Regression</h3>
            <p>Multiple linear regression involves multiple independent variables to predict the dependent variable. The relationship is represented by a hyperplane in higher-dimensional space.</p>

            <h2>Applications of Linear Regression</h2>
            <p>Linear regression is widely used in various fields, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Economics and finance for predicting stock prices and market trends</li>
                <li>Healthcare for predicting patient outcomes based on medical data</li>
                <li>Marketing for analyzing customer behavior and sales forecasting</li>
                <li>Engineering for modeling physical systems and predicting outcomes</li>
                <li>Social sciences for analyzing relationships between variables</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Challenges and Considerations</h2>
            <p>Challenges in linear regression include assumptions about data distribution, multicollinearity among variables, and outliers affecting model performance. Techniques like regularization and feature engineering are used to address these challenges.</p>
