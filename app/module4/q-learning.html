            <h2>Introduction to Q-Learning</h2>
            <p>Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm used to learn optimal actions in an environment without requiring a model of the environment's dynamics. It is based on the concept of the Q-value, which represents the expected utility of taking a specific action in a given state.</p>

            <h2>Key Concepts in Q-Learning</h2>
            <h3>1. Q-Value Update</h3>
            <p>The Q-value for a state-action pair is updated iteratively based on the reward received and the expected future rewards (discounted). This iterative update improves the policy over time.</p>

            <h3>2. Exploration vs. Exploitation</h3>
            <p>Q-learning balances exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing actions based on current knowledge) through strategies like epsilon-greedy exploration.</p>

            <h2>Applications of Q-Learning</h2>
            <p>Q-learning is applied in various scenarios, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Game playing and strategy optimization</li>
                <li>Robotics for path planning and control</li>
                <li>Financial trading and portfolio optimization</li>
                <li>Autonomous vehicle navigation</li>
                <li>Resource allocation and scheduling</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Challenges and Considerations</h2>
            <p>Challenges in Q-learning include defining suitable reward functions, handling large state spaces, and dealing with exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Techniques like deep Q-networks (DQNs) and prioritized experience replay are used to enhance Q-learning performance.</p>
