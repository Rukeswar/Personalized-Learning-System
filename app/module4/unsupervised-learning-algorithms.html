            <h2>Introduction to Unsupervised Learning</h2>
            <p>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns patterns from unlabeled data without any explicit feedback. It aims to uncover hidden structures and relationships within data.</p>

            <h2>Types of Unsupervised Learning Algorithms</h2>
            <h3>1. Clustering Algorithms</h3>
            <p>Clustering algorithms group similar data points into clusters based on similarity measures or distance metrics. Examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>K-means Clustering</li>
                <li>Hierarchical Clustering</li>
                <li>DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)</li>
                <li>Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)</li>
                <li>Agglomerative Clustering</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Association Rule Learning</h3>
            <p>Association rule learning discovers interesting relationships (associations) between variables in large datasets. It is often used in market basket analysis and recommendation systems.</p>

            <h2>Applications of Unsupervised Learning</h2>
            <p>Unsupervised learning algorithms find applications in various domains, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Market segmentation and customer profiling</li>
                <li>Anomaly detection and fraud detection</li>
                <li>Image and video analysis</li>
                <li>Natural language processing (NLP) for text clustering and topic modeling</li>
                <li>Bioinformatics for gene expression analysis and protein clustering</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Challenges and Considerations</h2>
            <p>Challenges in unsupervised learning include determining the optimal number of clusters, handling high-dimensional data, and interpreting the results without labeled ground truth. Techniques like dimensionality reduction and evaluation metrics are used to address these challenges.</p>
