            <h2>Approach to Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses various approaches and methodologies to simulate human intelligence and solve complex problems:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Symbolic AI</h3>
            <p>Symbolic AI, also known as classical AI, uses logic and rules to model intelligence:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Representing knowledge using symbols and logical operations.</li>
                <li>Inferring new knowledge based on predefined rules.</li>
                <li>Applications in expert systems, theorem proving, and automated reasoning.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>2. Connectionist AI</h3>
            <p>Connectionist AI, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, uses artificial neural networks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Modeling neurons and synaptic connections to learn patterns from data.</li>
                <li>Training neural networks through supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning.</li>
                <li>Applications in image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3. Evolutionary AI</h3>
            <p>Evolutionary AI applies principles of biological evolution to optimize solutions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generating and evolving candidate solutions using genetic algorithms.</li>
                <li>Simulating natural selection and mutation to improve performance over generations.</li>
                <li>Applications in optimization problems, robotics, and adaptive systems.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>4. Bayesian AI</h3>
            <p>Bayesian AI uses probabilistic methods to model uncertainty and infer patterns from data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using Bayesian inference to update beliefs and make decisions under uncertainty.</li>
                <li>Applications in medical diagnosis, financial forecasting, and risk analysis.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>5. Hybrid AI</h3>
            <p>Hybrid AI combines multiple AI techniques to leverage their strengths and overcome limitations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Integrating symbolic AI with neural networks for explainable AI systems.</li>
                <li>Combining evolutionary algorithms with deep learning for optimization and pattern recognition.</li>
                <li>Applications in complex decision-making, adaptive systems, and interdisciplinary research.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Future Directions</h2>
            <p>The future of AI involves advancing existing approaches and exploring new frontiers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhancing explainability and interpretability of AI models for trust and transparency.</li>
