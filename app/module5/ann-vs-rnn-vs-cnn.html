            <h2>Comparison of Architectures</h2>
            <p>Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are fundamental architectures in deep learning, each optimized for different types of data and tasks.</p>

            <h3>Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)</h3>
            <p>ANNs consist of interconnected layers of neurons, with each neuron connected to every neuron in the adjacent layers. They are used for tasks such as regression and classification where input data is independent and identically distributed (IID).</p>

            <h3>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)</h3>
            <p>RNNs process sequential data by maintaining state across time steps, allowing them to capture temporal dependencies. They are suitable for tasks like natural language processing, time series prediction, and speech recognition.</p>

            <h3>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</h3>
            <p>CNNs are designed for grid-like data such as images and videos, using convolutional layers to extract spatial hierarchies of features. They excel in tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.</p>

            <h2>Use Cases and Performance</h2>
            <p>The choice between ANN, RNN, and CNN depends on the nature of the data (sequential vs non-sequential, grid-like vs non-grid-like) and the specific requirements of the task (e.g., accuracy, speed, interpretability).</p>
