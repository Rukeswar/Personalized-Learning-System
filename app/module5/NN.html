            <h2>Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)</h2>
            <p>Feedforward neural networks are the simplest form of neural networks where data flows in one directionâ€”from input nodes through hidden layers to output nodes. They are used for tasks like classification and regression.</p>

            <h2>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)</h2>
            <p>Recurrent neural networks are designed to handle sequential data by maintaining internal memory (state) to process input sequences. They are effective for tasks like speech recognition, language modeling, and time series prediction.</p>

            <h2>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</h2>
            <p>Convolutional neural networks are specialized for processing grid-like data, such as images and videos. They use convolutional layers to automatically learn hierarchical representations of features, making them suitable for tasks like image classification and object detection.</p>

            <h2>Applications and Trade-offs</h2>
            <p>Each type of neural network has unique strengths and trade-offs in terms of computational complexity, training time, interpretability, and performance on specific tasks. Choosing the right architecture depends on the nature of the data and the problem domain.</p>
