            <h2>What are Neural Networks?</h2>
            <p>Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain's structure and function. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that process information and learn patterns from data.</p>

            <h2>Introduction to Deep Learning</h2>
            <p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to learn representations of data at multiple levels of abstraction. It has revolutionized areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.</p>

            <h2>Applications of Neural Networks and Deep Learning</h2>
            <p>Neural networks and deep learning have applications in various domains, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Image and video recognition</li>
                <li>Natural language processing and text analysis</li>
                <li>Speech recognition and synthesis</li>
                <li>Medical diagnosis and healthcare</li>
                <li>Autonomous vehicles and robotics</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Challenges and Future Directions</h2>
            <p>Challenges in neural networks and deep learning include training complex models, handling large datasets, interpreting black-box models, and addressing ethical considerations. Future directions involve research in explainable AI, reinforcement learning, and integrating AI with other technologies.</p>
